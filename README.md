# WalkBlockGet Plugin
 This is a server plugin that gives players the block that they walk on.

 This is the first plugin I've ever built so not the best code but code nonetheless.

 If you want ot use it just download the jar file and add it to tht plugins folder in your server files

 *How it works?*
 
 Pretty Simple really first make an event listener for the player movement and then if the player starts to move then store the location of the player and then subtract the y location by 1 to get the block underneath then get the material of that block and give it to that player

 
 There's not much but if you want to use the code your welcome to.
